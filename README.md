# TWSCardio

## Installation and Run

### Install CocoaPods

If you haven't installed CocoaPods yet, follow these steps:

**Step 1:**

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. To install CocoaPods, open your terminal and run:

`sudo gem install cocoapods`

**Step 2:**

Navigate to Project Directory

`cd /path/to/your/project`

### Install Chart and Starscream

Once your `Podfile` is set up, run the following command to install the pods:

`pod install`

This will install the `Charts` and `Starscream` libraries into your project and create a `.xcworkspace` file.

### Open the Project in Xcode

After installation, you should open the newly created `.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file:

`open EarCardioApplicationDemo.xcworkspace`

### **Build and Run Your Project**

With the workspace open in Xcode, select your target device and click the "Run" button to build and run the project.
